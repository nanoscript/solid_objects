The Ard_Mega_tray file is not a perfect fit, but is very very close, maybe a tiny bit loose.

The 608_repraper_spindle fits nice, only note is that the material-saving holes around the outer edge of the spindle are
not on a perfectly round path, this will show when the perimiters are printed. It does nothing to hurt the function of 
the part.

Both parts are in heights of even mm. Any layer height that multiplies evenly into 1mm will work,

*for the spindle the necessary bridge is .25mm thick, so works best with .25mm slices.
